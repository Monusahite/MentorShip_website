Coz bhot baar aisa hota h ki hmare paas proper study plan nhi hota ki konse topic ko kese pdhe , short notes kese bnae or short notes to mock k time bde useful hote h . Exam se phle bhi jb 2-3 din rhte h tb short notes hi revise krte h. So mentorship join krne k baad Ram bhaiya k short notes ne kaafi help ki . Mene Unke notes ko observe Kiya ki short notes kese bnane chahiye then mene khud k short notes prepare kiye and it was really helpful. One more thing ki preparation k time bhut baar aisa hota h ki kisi perticular topic me prblm hoti h tb smjh nhi aata kya kre but mentorship me seedhe bhiya ko call kiya ü§≠ or apni prblm btai then bhiya ne btaya ki kese or kitna pdhna h iss topic ko .also bhut baar demotivate bhi hui . actually last month me to m hr week hi demotivate ho jati thi so bhiya se baat ki and unhone really bhut motivate Kiya. Also mock k marks dekhne k baad bhi unke saath discussion hota tha and vo bolte ki paper ka proper analysis kro jaha bhi mistake ho rhi unko dekho so proper Analysis se kaafi mistake km hui .So mentorship ne proper guidance and motivation diya h mujhe. Thankyou so much Ram bhaiya. ~Anu Yadav`

When I successfully cracked four consecutive competitive exams in 2021, I was approached by many friends and aspiring candidates who either failed to succeed alongside me or were preparing for the following year. Through conversations with them, I realized that despite their hard work, many students struggle to achieve success. They expressed their frustrations, saying things like, "I didn't know which topics to prioritize or how to practice questions. We joined multiple test series, attended offline classes, and purchased study materials, but we still couldn't find success."</div>

The problem lies not with the students' efforts, as they put in a tremendous amount of hard work, but rather in the lack of proper guidance and direction. Many students find it challenging to manage themselves effectively. According to a survey conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training, approximately 81% of students in India suffer from stress, depression, and a lack of confidence. These factors often lead to a loss of confidence and impulsive decision-making. Students end up joining multiple institutes, practicing numerous test series, and purchasing various study materials and books, but remain dissatisfied with the results.
